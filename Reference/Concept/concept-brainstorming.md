# To-Do List System Concept Brainstorming
###### September 11, 2022

**Client Requirements:**  

* allow creation & addition of tasks to the list
* enforce a max capacity for the list to limit number of tasks allowed to be on the list at once (i.e., eight tasks maximum)
* allow repositioning tasks on the list at any time
* enable user to mark a task as 'complete' when it has been finished irl
* allow user to send completed tasks to an archive, both individually and in bulk
* allow user to view the completed task archive at any time
* allow user to delete tasks from the archive, both individually and in bulk; this deletion will result in permanent loss of task data
* allow user to delete tasks from the (to-do) list, both individually and in bulk; this results in permanent loss of task data
* enable user to set a task as 'important'; all tasks are assumed to have equal priority, except tasks marked as important, which have the alternate & highest level of priority
* actively display the number of completed tasks versus total tasks on active list
* actively display the number of tasks added to the list, versus the capacity of the list
* keep track of the number of tasks completed from a date set by the user up to present; will refer to this as the 'task odometer'
* allow user to view task odometer at any time
* allow user to reset task odometer at any time
* the task odometer will display the date last reset, and the number of tasks completed from then up to the present
