## 1 &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of System and Project Requirements

The following outlines all known system and project requirements, which will expand and contract as requirements are completed and new requirements are added.

| Requirement | Description/Comment | Rank | Scheduled Iter. |
|-------------|---------------------|------|-----------------|
| Add task to list | low risk, but is needed to build & test most other use cases. | High | PROTO. |
| Edit task on list | low risk, and low impact on other areas of the system. | Low | -- |
| Complete task on list | easy to implement with minimal impact, but is crucial to system functionality | Medium | PROTO. |
| Remove task from list | low risk and minimal impact, but adds functionality. | Low | -- |


&nbsp;
## 2 &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Project Risks

The following outlines all known project risks which will be edited as risks
are mitigated, and as new risks arise.

| Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Description |
|------------------|-------------|--------|------------------------|
| | | | |


&nbsp;
## 3 &nbsp;&nbsp; Archive of Completed Requirements and Risks

The following is an archive of project requirements that have been completed, as well as project risks that have been mitigated, organized accordingly.  

To use: select target requirement/risk and perform a cut, then navigate to the corresponding table and paste the (cut) content into a new row of that table. Lastly, add the iteration number when the requirement/risk was completed, or the iteration when it was archived, if when it was completed is unknown.  


##### Completed Requirements

| Requirement | Description/Comment | Rank | Iteration Completed |
|-------------|---------------------|------|---------------------|
| | | | |


&nbsp;
##### Mitigated Risks

| Risk Description | Prblty | Impact | Mitigation Descrip. | Iter. Mitigated |
|------------------|--------|--------|---------------------|-----------------|
