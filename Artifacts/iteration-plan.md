## 1 &nbsp;&nbsp; Objectives Checklist for Current Iteration

- [ ] Create project repo and set up with initial files & folders
	+ [ ] Provide README with basic introduction of project
	+ [ ] Merge the two current (working) versions of the repo to form one cohesive version
	+ [ ] Organize repo into 'artifacts' and 'src' folders  

- [ ] Create a tentative iteration plan for this (current) iteration  

- [ ] Create a development log for keeping an overview of project risks & requirements
	+ [ ] Add all identifiable project risks
	+ [ ] Add all identifiable project requirements  

- [ ] Create a vision document, include the following sections:
	+ [ ] Introduction (& Problem Statement)
	+ [ ] Users & User-Level Goals
	+ [ ] Summary of System Features  

- [ ] Create a document for storing all use case descriptions, then:
	+ [ ] Record brief descriptions for all identifiable use cases of the system
	+ [ ] Record detailed descriptions for four primary use cases:
		* [ ] UC1
		* [ ] UC2
		* [ ] UC3
		* [ ] UC4  

- [ ] Create sequence diagrams for each of the four primary use cases:
	+ [ ] UC1
	+ [ ] UC2
	+ [ ] UC3
	+ [ ] UC4  

- [ ] Create UI prototype sketches for each of the four primary use cases:
	+ [ ] UC1
	+ [ ] UC2
	+ [ ] UC3
	+ [ ] UC4  

- [ ] Produce an initial domain model for the system  

- [ ] Produce a basic working prototype of the system which implements functionality for each of the primary use cases, including a GUI  

- [ ] Create a (tentative) iteration plan for the next iteration

## 2 &nbsp;&nbsp; Plan for Current Iteration (Prototype)

During the current iteration we plan to:

* initialise project artifacts and conduct initial project analysis & requirements gathering; focusing on identifying the primary users of the system and their goals
* produce a vision document to summarize initial project analysis & requirements gathering, including analysis of project risks
* identify all initial use cases of the system, recording a brief use case description for each
* analyse the "", "", "", and "" use cases, for each producing:
	- a full use case description
	- a sequence diagram
	- a UI prototype sketch
* identify components of the domain of the system and produce a domain model
* implement code for each of the four use cases of focus (to match each detailed description), along with GUI components, such that a basic working prototype of the system is produced
* analyse project development to determine next steps, to be summarized in the plan for the next iteration


&nbsp;
## 3 &nbsp;&nbsp; Plan for Next Iteration (Iter. \#1)

In the next iteration, we plan to:
